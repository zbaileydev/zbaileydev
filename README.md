## Quick Rundown
- 👋 Hi, I’m @PuzzleZach, a programmer in the tech industry with a passion for building tools.
- I’m interested in game development, any engine is fine with me as they all bring unique strengths. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on any tools to assist creators and indie studios.

## Fun Past Projects:
- [EmThreat](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/EmThreat) is a tool to help system administrators identify new trends in vulnerable software. 
- [TwitterFollowing](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/TwitterFollowing) is a quick utility to pull info of people you follow to save contact information.
- [PyJira](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/PyJira) is a short utility to making YARA rule files from an input file. I do not know why I called it PyJira.
- [Glass](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/lookingglass) is a set of utilities to automatically search through IOS apps, specifically the GlassDoor app.

## Current Work:
- If you want more advanced samples, feel free to reach out and I can build examples on demand.

## Future Work:
- Working on a Camera RPG. More details coming soon.
- Exploring creating a job site for game developers.
- Planning to build a tool for tracking assets and licenses.
