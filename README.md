## Rundown
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zach, I've been programming for over 4 years in a variety of languages from Python to C#. 
- My main interest is game development, with a focus on building tools to help developers.
- I currently lead the development of platform tools at a security company.
- I'm open to work on indie games, if you need something done I can find a way to implement it.

## Game Development:
- I'll try to keep my blog updated at https://zbaileydev.github.io/
- [Extraction Game](https://github.com/zbaileydev/Extraction-Code) are scripts for a Helldivers inspired top-down shooter.
- [Unity Tools](https://github.com/zbaileydev/UnityTools) will hold any tools I develop while solving problems I face in Unity.
- [AI Spawning](https://github.com/zbaileydev/AI_Aware_Spawn) is a basic way to jumpscare players by spawning enemies where they are not looking, inspired by Turtle Rock Studios. 

## Past Projects:
- [EmThreat](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/EmThreat) is a tool to help system administrators identify new trends in vulnerable software. 
- [TwitterFollowing](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/TwitterFollowing) is a quick utility to pull info of people you follow to save contact information.
- [Glass](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/lookingglass) is a set of utilities to automatically search through IOS apps, specifically the GlassDoor app.
